# Demo survey with predefined random labels

::: {.callout-note}
This is a demo survey showcasing the functionality of <a href="https://surveydown.org" target="_blank">surveydown</a>. It doesn't collect any data.

The GitHub repo of this demo can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/surveydown-dev/demo-randomized-question-labels-predefined" target="_blank">here</a>.

Here is a basic "multiple choice" question where the labels are randomly sampled from 1 to 100.

The random samples are grabbed from a **pre-defined** csv file.

If you refresh the page, the options should change.

```{r}
sd_output("q1", type = "question")
sd_next()
```

```{r}
sd_next()
```

```{r}
sd_close()
```
